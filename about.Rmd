Welcome to my personal website! I am a neuroscientist, digital illustrator, sketch artist, and a Postdoctoral fellow at Italian Institute of Technology in the Brain Disease and Development Department. 

I study neurodevelopmental disorder, Down syndrome with a focus on multi-omics analysis and human induced pluripotent stem cells. 

Thanks for visiting my site, and I am grateful for any feedback you may have!

Cheers,

Mohit
